4.  Branches represent an independent line of development, and serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
    The branches are pointers to changes made in the repository, they server to encapsulate the changes.

5.  git log allows you to list the project history, filter it, and look
    for specific changes. git status will let you inspect the working directory
    and tje staging area.

6.  $ git log Vehicle.h

7.  $ git log --all --grep='file'

8.  Inheritance- is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class , retaining similar implementation. Sub classes can inherit
                    methods and functions that the parent class has, this way we can reuse code effeciently and maintain similar behaviors.

    Polymorphism- allows a single body of code to work with objects of multiple types

    Encapsulation- is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties’ direct access to them. 
                    Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve 
                    and modify the values within the object.

9.  The main difference  between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow is that in a “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow
    is that the developers do not have two repositories, they can only pull from the central repository.

10. A centralized workflow is a single collaboration model. Esentially one developer can push their changes no problem, however subseqent developers must merge to the most recent
    repository. Then push as to not overwrite the first developers code, this works well with small groups and can be applied to larger groups if disciplend enough. However, for
    large groups 100's and more, the “Dictator and Lieutenants” allows for a more structured process. Various integration managers (Lieutenants) have one integration manager above
    them the benevolant Dictator.  It allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.
